Cerise's Unity Game (Platformer / Puzzle game) : 

Play as a Humanoid plagued by
worst nightmares. At the junction between
two realities, alternate between a world
rooted in reality and a cursed world
in order to escape the monstrous Thing
who chases you. Contaminated by a
corruption which increasingly parasitizes
your being, flee as quickly as possible before

don't lose your humanity...
